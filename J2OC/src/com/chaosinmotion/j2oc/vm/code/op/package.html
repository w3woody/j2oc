<p>An operator represents an interemediate operation in a collection of operations that
comprise an instruction. An instruction represents a single generated statement.</p>
<p>The difference is deliberate: when one instruction evaluates a collection of
operators, we can express this as a single C or Objective C statement: thus, the
operators:<br><br>

push 1<br>
push 2<br>
add<br>
push 3<br>
mul<br>
arraynew int<br>

will generate new[(1+2)*3];</p>

<p>This implies that if we execute a statement that doesn't return anything, then we need
to close out our operators by using temporary registers.</p>
